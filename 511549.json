    "question": "The sum of three numbers is 98. If the ratio of the first number to the second is 2:3 and the ratio of the second number to the third is 5:8, then what is the third number?",

    "option_2": "30",
    "option_3": "20",
    "option_4": "49",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "Let the three numbers be a, b, and c. Given, a:b = 2:3 and b:c = 5:8. To find the combined ratio a:b:c, we make 'b' common by finding the LCM of 3 and 5, which is 15. So, a:b = 10:15 and b:c = 15:24. Thus, a:b:c = 10:15:24. Let the numbers be 10x, 15x, and 24x. According to the question, 10x + 15x + 24x = 98. This simplifies to 49x = 98, so x = 2. The third number is 24x = 24 * 2 = 48."

    "question": "A large container contains 50 liters of a mixture of juice and water in the ratio 3:2. 60 liters of a mixture of juice and water are added to it, which makes the ratio of juice and water 2:1.

    "option_3": "4 : 7",
    "option_4": "18 : 37",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Initial mixture: 50L with Juice:Water = 3:2. So, Juice = 30L, Water = 20L. After adding 60L of another mixture, the total volume is 110L with Juice:Water = 2:1. So, Total Juice = (2/3)*110 = 220/3 L, Total Water = (1/3)*110 = 110/3 L. Now, 11L of this mixture is removed. Water removed = (1/3)*11 = 11/3 L. Juice removed = (2/3)*11 = 22/3 L. Remaining Water = 110/3 - 11/3 = 99/3 = 33L. Remaining Juice = 220/3 - 22/3 = 198/3 = 66L. Then 11L of pure juice is added. Final Juice = 66 + 11 = 77L. Final Water = 33L. The ratio of water to juice is 33:77, which simplifies to 3:7. Note: The provided answer key leads to 18:37, suggesting a different interpretation of the problem statement."

    "solution": "The total age of the three men who were replaced is 35 + 48 + 49 = 132 years. The total age of the committee increased by 10 persons * 3 years/person = 30 years. This means the total age of the three women is 30 years more than the total age of the three men they replaced. Total age of the three women = 132 + 30 = 162 years. The average age of the three women is 162 / 3 = 54 years."

    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Given: Remainder = 46. Divisor = 5 × Remainder = 5 × 46 = 230. Also, Divisor = 10 × Quotient. So, 230 = 10 × Quotient, which means the Quotient is 23. The formula for the dividend is: Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder. So, Dividend = (230 × 23) + 46 = 5290 + 46 = 5336."

The difference in their expenditure is 2.5x - 1.5x = x. Given that this difference is ₹ 4,500, we have x = 4500. B's income is 3x, so 3 * 4500 = ₹13,500.

SP = 0.80 * (2x) = 1.6x. We are given that the SP is Rs 1200. So, 1.6x = 1200. Solving for x, we get x = 1200 / 1.6 = 750. The value of x is ₹750."

Substituting the given values: 4³ = 52 + 3ab(4) => 64 = 52 + 12ab => 12ab = 12 => ab = 1. Also, a² + b² = (a+b)² - 2ab = 4² - 2(1) = 16 - 2 = 14. So, the value of a² + b² - ab = 14 - 1 = 13.

    "solution": "Let the Cost Price (CP) be 100. With a 16% profit, the Selling Price (SP) is 116. This SP is after a 20% discount on the Marked Price (MP), so SP = 80% of MP. 116 = 0.8 * MP, so MP = 116 / 0.8 = 145. If the item is sold at the MP, the new SP is 145. The profit would be SP - CP = 145 - 100 = 45. The profit percentage would be (45/100) * 100 = 45%."

The total work can be expressed in terms of one unit, say W: (2(2.5W) + 5W) * 8 = (5W + 5W) * 8 = 80W. To complete this work in 4 days, the required work rate is 80W / 4 = 20W per day. Since 1M = 2.5W, the number of men required is 20W / 2.5W = 8 men."

    "solution": "Given CD = DA, triangle ADC is isosceles, so ∠DAC = ∠DCA. Let this angle be x. The exterior angle ∠BDC of triangle ADC is the sum of the opposite interior angles, so ∠BDC = ∠DAC + ∠DCA = 2x. We are given ∠BDC = 76°, so 2x = 76°, which means x = 38°. Since CD bisects ∠BCA, ∠BCD is also x, so ∠BCD = 38°. In triangle BDC, the sum of angles is 180°. So, ∠CBD + ∠BDC + ∠BCD = 180°. ∠CBD + 76° + 38° = 180°. ∠CBD + 114° = 180°. Therefore, ∠CBD = 66°."

The equation becomes: 54 – (4 × 12) ÷ 2 + (11 × 3) + 6. Now, solving with BODMAS: 54 - (48 ÷ 2) + 33 + 6 = 54 - 24 + 33 + 6 = 30 + 39 = 69. This balances the equation."

The rise in water level (height) is the volume displaced divided by the area of the pool. Height = 90 m³ / 2250 m² = 0.04 m. To convert this to centimeters, multiply by 100: 0.04 * 100 = 4 cm."
