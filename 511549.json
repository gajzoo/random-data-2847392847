    "question": "The sum of three numbers is 98. If the ratio of the first number to the second is 2:3 and the ratio of the second number to the third is 5:8, then what is the third number?",
    "option_1": "48",
    "option_2": "30",
    "option_3": "20",
    "option_4": "49",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "Let the first, second, and third numbers be a, b, and c. We are given a:b = 2:3 and b:c = 5:8. To find the ratio a:b:c, we make the value of 'b' consistent. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. So, a:b becomes 10:15, and b:c becomes 15:24. The combined ratio a:b:c is 10:15:24. Let the numbers be 10x, 15x, and 24x. Their sum is 10x + 15x + 24x = 98, which simplifies to 49x = 98. Therefore, x = 2. The third number is 24x = 24 * 2 = 48."

    "question": "A person buys some bananas at the rate of ₹ Y per dozen and sells them at the rate of ₹ Y/4 per banana. What is his profit percentage?",
    "option_1": "80%",
    "option_2": "50%",
    "option_3": "200%",
    "option_4": "100%",
    "answer": "3",
    "solution": "According to the question, the Cost Price (CP) of 12 bananas is ₹ Y. The Selling Price (SP) of 1 banana is ₹ Y/4. Therefore, the SP of 12 bananas is 12 * (Y/4) = ₹ 3Y. Profit = SP - CP = 3Y - Y = 2Y. The profit percentage is (Profit / CP) * 100 = (2Y / Y) * 100 = 200%."

    "question": "A large container contains 50 liters of a mixture of juice and water in the ratio 3:2. 60 liters of a mixture of juice and water are added to it, which makes the ratio of juice and water 2:1. After this, 11 liters of the mixture is replaced with pure juice. Find the ratio of water and juice in the final mixture.",

    "option_2": "29 : 81",
    "option_3": "4 : 7",
    "option_4": "18 : 37",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Initial mixture: 50L with Juice:Water = 3:2. This means Juice = 30L, Water = 20L. After adding 60L of another mixture, the total volume becomes 110L with a new Juice:Water ratio of 2:1. In this 110L mixture, Juice = (2/3)*110 = 220/3 L and Water = (1/3)*110 = 110/3 L. Now, 11 liters of this mixture are removed. The amount of water removed is (110/3) / 110 * 11 = 11/3 L. The amount of juice removed is (220/3) / 110 * 11 = 22/3 L. The remaining water is 110/3 - 11/3 = 33L. The remaining juice is 220/3 - 22/3 = 66L. Finally, 11L of pure juice is added. Final juice = 66 + 11 = 77L. Final water remains 33L. The ratio of water to juice is 33:77 = 3:7. Note: The provided answer key leads to 18:37, suggesting a different interpretation or values in the original problem."

    "option_2": "74",
    "option_3": "44",
    "option_4": "64",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "The total age of the three men being replaced is 35 + 48 + 49 = 132 years. The average age of the 10-person committee increased by 3 years, so the total age of the committee increased by 10 * 3 = 30 years. This increase is the difference between the total age of the new women and the men they replaced. Thus, the total age of the three women is 132 + 30 = 162 years. The average age of the three women is 162 / 3 = 54 years."

    "option_3": "5972",
    "option_4": "5336",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Given the remainder is 46. The divisor is 5 times the remainder, so Divisor = 5 * 46 = 230. The divisor is also 10 times the quotient, so 230 = 10 * Quotient, which means Quotient = 23. Using the division formula, Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder. Therefore, Dividend = (230 × 23) + 46 = 5290 + 46 = 5336."

    "solution": "The purchase price (Cost Price) is x. After a 100% markup, the Marked Price (MP) is x + x = 2x. A discount of 20% is applied to the MP, so the Selling Price (SP) is 80% of 2x, which is 1.6x. We know the SP is Rs 1200. So, 1.6x = 1200. Therefore, x = 1200 / 1.6 = 750."

    "option_1": "8",
    "option_2": "14",
    "option_3": "16",
    "option_4": "7",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "The expression to evaluate is (a-b)² + ab = a² - 2ab + b² + ab = a² + b² - ab. We use the identity (a+b)³ = a³ + b³ + 3ab(a+b). Substituting the given values: 4³ = 52 + 3ab(4), which gives 64 = 52 + 12ab. Solving for ab, we get 12ab = 12, so ab = 1. Next, we find a² + b² using the identity (a+b)² = a² + b² + 2ab. So, 4² = a² + b² + 2(1), which gives 16 = a² + b² + 2. Thus, a² + b² = 14. Finally, substituting into our target expression: a² + b² - ab = 14 - 1 = 13.

    "option_2": "36%",
    "option_3": "35%",

    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "Let the Cost Price (CP) be ₹100. With a 16% profit, the Selling Price (SP) is ₹116. Since the item was sold at a 20% discount on the Marked Price (MP), the SP is 80% of the MP. So, 0.8 * MP = 116. This gives MP = 116 / 0.8 = ₹145. If the item were sold at the marked price, the new SP would be ₹145. The new profit would be 145 - 100 = ₹45. The profit percentage would be (45/100) * 100 = 45%."

    "option_4": "12",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "Let a man's one-day work be M and a woman's be W. The total work is equal in both scenarios: (2M + 5W) * 8 = (4M + 6W) * 5. Expanding this gives 16M + 40W = 20M + 30W. Rearranging the terms, we get 10W = 4M, which means 1M = 2.5W. The total work can be calculated using one of the scenarios: (2 * 2.5W + 5W) * 8 = (5W + 5W) * 8 = 80W. To complete this in 4 days, a work rate of 80W / 4 = 20W per day is needed. Since 1 man's work is 2.5W, the number of men required is 20W / 2.5W = 8."

    "option_3": "80°",
    "option_4": "32°",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "Since CD = DA, triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle, meaning ∠DAC = ∠DCA. Let this angle be x. In triangle ADC, the exterior angle ∠BDC is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles, so ∠BDC = ∠DAC + ∠DCA = 2x. Given ∠BDC = 76°, we have 2x = 76°, so x = 38°. Since CD bisects ∠BCA, ∠BCD is also equal to x, so ∠BCD = 38°. Now, considering triangle BDC, the sum of its angles is 180°. Therefore, ∠CBD + ∠BDC + ∠BCD = 180°. Substituting the known values: ∠CBD + 76° + 38° = 180°. This simplifies to ∠CBD + 114° = 180°. Thus, ∠CBD = 66°."
