    "question": "The sum of three numbers is 98. If the ratio of the first number to the second is 2:3 and the ratio of the second number to the third is 5:8, then what is the third number?",
    "option_1": "48",
    "option_2": "30",
    "option_3": "20",
    "option_4": "49",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "Let the first, second, and third numbers be a, b, and c. We are given a:b = 2:3 and b:c = 5:8. To find the ratio a:b:c, we make the value of 'b' consistent. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. So, a:b becomes 10:15, and b:c becomes 15:24. The combined ratio a:b:c is 10:15:24. Let the numbers be 10x, 15x, and 24x. Their sum is 10x + 15x + 24x = 98, which simplifies to 49x = 98. Therefore, x = 2. The third number is 24x = 24 * 2 = 48."

    "question": "A person buys some bananas at the rate of ₹ Y per dozen and sells them at the rate of ₹ Y/4 per banana. What is his profit percentage?",
    "option_1": "80%",
    "option_2": "50%",
    "option_3": "200%",
    "option_4": "100%",
    "answer": "3",
    "solution": "According to the question, the Cost Price (CP) of 12 bananas is ₹ Y. The Selling Price (SP) of 1 banana is ₹ Y/4. Therefore, the SP of 12 bananas is 12 * (Y/4) = ₹ 3Y. Profit = SP - CP = 3Y - Y = 2Y. The profit percentage is (Profit / CP) * 100 = (2Y / Y) * 100 = 200%."

    "question": "A large container contains 50 liters of a mixture of juice and water in the ratio 3:2. 60 liters of a mixture of juice and water are added to it, which makes the ratio of juice and water 2:1. After this, 11 liters of the mixture is replaced with pure juice. Find the ratio of water and juice in the final mixture.",
    "option_1": "37 : 18",
    "option_2": "29 : 81",
    "option_3": "4 : 7",
    "option_4": "18 : 37",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Initial mixture: 50L with Juice:Water = 3:2. This means Juice = 30L, Water = 20L. Let the added 60L mixture have juice 'j' and water 'w' (j+w=60). The new mixture is (30+j):(20+w) = 2:1. This gives 30+j = 2(20+w) => 30+j = 40+2w. Using j=60-w, we get 30+60-w = 40+2w => 90-w=40+2w => 50=3w => w=50/3 L, j=130/3 L. Total Juice = 30+130/3 = 220/3 L. Total Water = 20+50/3 = 110/3 L. Ratio is 2:1. Now, 11L is removed. Water removed = (1/3)*11 = 11/3 L. Juice removed = (2/3)*11 = 22/3 L. Remaining water = 110/3 - 11/3 = 99/3 = 33L. Remaining juice = 220/3 - 22/3 = 198/3 = 66L. Add 11L juice. Final juice = 66+11=77L. Final water=33L. Ratio water:juice = 33:77 = 3:7. The desired answer is 18:37, which points to different initial values."

    "option_2": "₹7000",
    "option_3": "₹10000",
    "option_4": "₹2500",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "The total expenditure is ₹50,000. From the pie chart, transportation accounts for 10% of the total expenditure. Therefore, the expenditure on transportation is 10% of 50,000 = (10/100) * 50000 = ₹5000."

    "question": "The average age of a committee of 10 persons increases by 3 when three women replace three men aged 35 years, 48 ​​years and 49 years. Find the average age (in years) of the three women.",
    "option_1": "54",
    "option_2": "74",
    "option_3": "44",
    "option_4": "64",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "The total age of the three men being replaced is 35 + 48 + 49 = 132 years. The average age of the 10-person committee increased by 3 years, so the total age of the committee increased by 10 * 3 = 30 years. This increase is the difference between the total age of the new women and the men they replaced. Thus, the total age of the three women is 132 + 30 = 162 years. The average age of the three women is 162 / 3 = 54 years."

    "option_2": "4286",
    "option_3": "5972",
    "option_4": "5336",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Given, Remainder = 46. Divisor = 5 × Remainder = 5 × 46 = 230. Also, Divisor = 10 × Quotient, so 230 = 10 × Quotient, which means Quotient = 23. We know that Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder. So, Dividend = (230 × 23) + 46 = 5290 + 46 = 5336."
